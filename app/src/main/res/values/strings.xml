    <string name="info_item_1_title">What is a Stingray?</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_1">\"A Stingray is a device that pretends to be a cell phone tower. When it is turned on, it sends out a ping to all cellular devices within the reach of its signal and informs the devices that the Stingray is now online. \"</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_2">It informs the devices they should disconnect from the tower they are currently connected to, and register with the Stingray.</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_3">Stingrays are commonly referred to as IMSI Catchers, Dirtboxes, Kingfish, HailStorm, Stingray I, Stingray II, Gossamer, Triggerfish Cell Tower Simulators, and Cell Site Simulators.</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_4">Stingrays are mostly manufactured by the Florida company Harris Corporation.</string>
    <string name="info_item_2_title">What can Stingrays do?</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_5">Stingrays can intercept and forward the data and communications from all cellular devices that are within the area of range of the Stingray\'s antennae. Unencrypted data like text messages and phone calls are particularly vulnerable.</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_6">Stingrays can be used to block all incoming and outgoing information from reaching cell phones in the area of effect of the Stingray.</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_7">Theoretically, a Stingray could be used to invoke a cellphone\'s built-in over-the-air update mechanism, forcing the phone to install a malicious software update or to download a malicious app without the knowledge or authorization of the user.</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_8">With the help of a device called an AmberJack, Stingrays can be used to triangulate the exact location of target cell phones, including phones that do not have location services enabled.</string>
    <string name="info_item_3_title">Who uses Stingrays?</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_9">Stingrays were originally developed for use by the U.S. Navy, but since then have been de-regulated by the FCC so that anybody with an antenna can create and operate a Stingray</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_10">Predominately, these devices are purchased and used by the U.S. Federal government, as well as State and local police and sheriff departments.</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_11">Among the list of federal agencies known to own and operate Stingrays, is the FBI, DEA, ICE, the Dept. of Justice, and the U.S. Marshals Service.</string>
    <string name="info_item_4_title">How does RayDos help?</string>
    <string name="info_item_details_12">While running, RayDos will send out text messages with pre-defined content or with randomized content, in an attempt to overwhelm the StingRay and to make it harder for watching parties to discern real texts from ones generated by RayDos.</string>
